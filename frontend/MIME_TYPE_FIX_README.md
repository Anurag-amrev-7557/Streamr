# MIME Type Fix for Service Worker

## Problem Description

The application was experiencing MIME type errors when loading JavaScript modules:

```
Failed to load module script: Expected a JavaScript-or-Wasm module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.
```

This error occurs when:
1. The service worker tries to load JavaScript files
2. The server serves these files with `text/html` MIME type instead of `application/javascript`
3. The browser enforces strict MIME type checking for ES modules

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Robust Service Worker Manager

Created `src/utils/serviceWorkerRegistration.js` - a comprehensive service worker manager that:
- Handles MIME type errors gracefully
- Provides retry logic for non-MIME type errors
- Automatically detects development vs production environments
- Waits for the app to be fully loaded before registration

### 2. Development-Specific Service Worker

Created `public/dev-sw.js` - a development service worker that:
- Intercepts JavaScript and CSS file requests
- Fixes MIME type mismatches on-the-fly
- Provides fallback responses for failed requests
- Minimizes caching in development mode

### 3. Environment-Aware Registration

The service worker manager automatically chooses the appropriate service worker:
- **Development**: Uses `/dev-sw.js` with MIME type handling
- **Production**: Uses `/sw.js` with full caching features

### 4. Vite Configuration Updates

Updated `vite.config.js` to:
- Set proper MIME type headers for development server
- Handle service worker registration in development mode
- Ensure proper file extensions and MIME types in production builds

## Files Modified

1. **`src/App.jsx`** - Replaced manual service worker registration with manager
2. **`src/utils/serviceWorkerRegistration.js`** - New robust service worker manager
3. **`public/dev-sw.js`** - New development service worker
4. **`vite.config.js`** - Added MIME type handling and service worker configuration
5. **`test-mime-fix.js`** - Test script to verify fixes

## Usage

### Automatic Registration

The service worker now registers automatically when the app loads:

```javascript
// In App.jsx - automatically handled
import serviceWorkerManager from './utils/serviceWorkerRegistration'

// Registration happens automatically
```

### Manual Testing

Use the test script to verify the fix:

```javascript
// In browser console
// Load the test script first
// Then run:
testMimeTypeFixes.runAllTests()
```

### Development vs Production

- **Development**: Automatically uses development service worker with MIME type fixes
- **Production**: Uses production service worker with full caching features

## Error Handling

The service worker manager handles different types of errors:

1. **MIME Type Errors**: Logged and skipped (no retry)
2. **Network Errors**: Retried up to 3 times with exponential backoff
3. **Registration Errors**: Logged with detailed error information

## Benefits

1. **No More MIME Type Errors**: JavaScript files load with correct MIME types
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for various error scenarios
3. **Environment Awareness**: Different service workers for different environments
4. **Robust Registration**: Retry logic and proper error handling
5. **Development Friendly**: Better debugging and error reporting

## Troubleshooting

### If MIME Type Errors Persist

1. Check that the development service worker is being used:
   ```javascript
   // In console
   navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistration().then(reg => {
     console.log('Service Worker:', reg.active?.scriptURL);
   });
   ```

2. Verify the service worker is active:
   ```javascript
   // In console
   navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(reg => {
     console.log('Service Worker ready:', reg.active);
   });
   ```

3. Check for console errors related to service worker registration

### If Service Worker Won't Register

1. Check browser support:
   ```javascript
   'serviceWorker' in navigator
   ```

2. Check for HTTPS requirement (service workers require secure context in production)

3. Verify file paths are correct

## Performance Impact

- **Development**: Minimal impact, development service worker is lightweight
- **Production**: No impact, uses existing production service worker
- **Error Handling**: Slight overhead for error detection and handling

## Future Improvements

1. **Service Worker Updates**: Automatic updates when new versions are available
2. **Offline Support**: Enhanced offline functionality
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Service worker performance metrics
4. **A/B Testing**: Different service worker strategies for testing

## Support

For issues or questions about the MIME type fix:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Run the test script to identify specific problems
3. Verify the correct service worker is being used for your environment
