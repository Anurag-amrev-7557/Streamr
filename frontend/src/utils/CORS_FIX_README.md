# CORS Fix for TMDB Images

## Problem
The application was experiencing CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to load images directly from TMDB's CDN (`https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/...`). The browser was blocking these requests because TMDB doesn't include the necessary CORS headers.

## Solution
Instead of using a proxy server, we implemented a client-side solution using the `crossorigin` attribute on image elements.

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Created `imageUtils.js`** - A centralized utility for handling TMDB image URLs with proper CORS handling
2. **Updated `imageOptimizationService.js`** - Added `crossOrigin: 'anonymous'` to all image generation functions
3. **Updated `OptimizedImage.jsx`** - Added `crossOrigin="anonymous"` attribute to the img element
4. **Updated `performanceOptimizationService.js`** - Added CORS handling to image loading functions
5. **Updated multiple components** - Replaced direct TMDB URL usage with the new utility functions

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/utils/imageUtils.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/services/imageOptimizationService.js`
- `frontend/src/components/OptimizedImage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/services/performanceOptimizationService.js`
- `frontend/src/components/NetflixLevelRecommendations.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/VirtualizedMovieGrid.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/MoviesPage.jsx`
- `frontend/src/components/HomePage.jsx`

### Usage:
```javascript
import { getPosterProps, getBackdropProps } from '../utils/imageUtils';

// For poster images
const posterProps = getPosterProps(movie, 'w500');
<img {...posterProps} className="movie-poster" />

// For backdrop images
const backdropProps = getBackdropProps(movie, 'w780');
<img {...backdropProps} className="backdrop-image" />
```

### Benefits:
- ✅ No proxy server required
- ✅ Better performance (direct CDN access)
- ✅ Proper CORS handling
- ✅ Centralized image URL management
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ✅ Automatic fallback to placeholder images

### Testing:
A test component `TestImageCors.jsx` was created to verify the fix works correctly. You can import and use it to test image loading.

## Notes:
- The `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute tells the browser to make a CORS request without sending credentials
- This works because TMDB's CDN allows anonymous cross-origin requests
- If an image fails to load, the application gracefully falls back to placeholder images
- All image preloading and optimization features are preserved
