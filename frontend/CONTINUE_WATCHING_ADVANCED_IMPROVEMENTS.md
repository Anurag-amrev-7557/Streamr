# Continue Watching Component - Advanced Improvements

## Overview
The ContinueWatching component has been upgraded to the most advanced level with sophisticated optimizations, intelligent caching, and enhanced user experience features.

## üöÄ Advanced Features Implemented

### 1. **Intelligent Image Loading & Optimization**
- **Priority Loading System**: First 3 cards load immediately with `eager` loading and `high` priority
- **Lazy Loading**: Other cards use Intersection Observer with 5% threshold and 100px pre-load margin
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Show loading spinner while images load
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback UI for failed image loads
- **Load Timeout**: 8-second timeout to prevent indefinite loading states
- **Optimized Image Sources**: Smart selection between poster/backdrop based on device type

### 2. **Advanced Season Progress Tracking**
- **Intelligent Caching**: 5-minute cache with timestamp tracking
- **Duplicate Request Prevention**: Prevents multiple simultaneous fetches for same season
- **Loading States**: Visual loading indicators during data fetch
- **Staggered Loading**: 100ms delay per item to prevent API congestion
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback data when API fails
- **Precise Calculations**: Progress rounded to 1 decimal place for accuracy

### 3. **Smart Progress Display**

  - Mounted ref tracking
  - Timeout clearing on unmount
  - Event listener cleanup
  - Cache management
- **Performance Optimization**:
  - React.memo with custom comparison
  - useMemo for expensive calculations
  - useCallback for event handlers
  - Ref-based state management where appropriate

### 9. **Enhanced UI Components**
- **Item Count Badges**: Real-time display of total items
- **Dropdown Menus**:
  - Item count per category in dropdown
  - Disabled states when categories are empty
  - Animated chevron rotation
  - Click-outside detection with delay
- **Loading Indicators**:
  - Spinning loader for refresh state
  - Shimmer effects for loading progress bars
  - Skeleton screens for image loading

### 10. **Advanced Episode Information**
- **Improved Formatting**:
  - Zero-padded episode numbers (S01 E05)
  - Multiple metadata display (year, type, duration, episode)
  - Flexible layout with wrapping support
- **TV Show Enhancements**:
  - Season-specific progress tracking
  - Episode count display
  - Next episode prompts
