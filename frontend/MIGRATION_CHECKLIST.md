# Migration Checklist: MovieDetailsOverlay Improvements

## Pre-Migration Steps

### 1. Backup Current Version ✅
```bash
cd frontend/src/components
cp MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx.backup
git add MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx.backup
git commit -m "Backup original MovieDetailsOverlay before improvements"
```

### 2. Review Dependencies ✅
Ensure these are available:
- [ ] `react` (v18+)
- [ ] `framer-motion`
- [ ] `react-window` (for virtual lists)
- [ ] All TMDB service functions
- [ ] All context hooks (Watchlist, ViewingProgress)
- [ ] Portal management hook (`usePortal`)
- [ ] Image optimization service

### 3. Run Tests Before Migration ✅
```bash
npm test -- MovieDetailsOverlay
```
Document current test results for comparison.

## Migration Options

### Option A: Gradual Migration (Recommended)
Use the improved version alongside the old one:

```bash
# Keep both versions
mv MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx MovieDetailsOverlay.legacy.jsx
mv MovieDetailsOverlay.improved.jsx MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx
```

Pros:
- ✅ Easy rollback if issues arise
- ✅ Can A/B test performance
- ✅ Lower risk

Cons:
- ⚠️ Temporarily increases bundle size

### Option B: Direct Replacement
Replace immediately:

```bash
cp MovieDetailsOverlay.improved.jsx MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx
```

Pros:
- ✅ Immediate benefits
- ✅ Clean codebase

Cons:
- ⚠️ Higher risk
- ⚠️ Harder to rollback

## Migration Steps (Gradual Approach)

### Step 1: Integrate Improved Version
```bash
# Copy improved version
cp MovieDetailsOverlay.improved.jsx MovieDetailsOverlay.new.jsx
```

### Step 2: Update Import in Parent Component
```javascript
// Before
import MovieDetailsOverlay from './components/MovieDetailsOverlay';

// After (for testing)
import MovieDetailsOverlay from './components/MovieDetailsOverlay.new';
```

### Step 3: Test Core Functionality

- [ ] Poster images display (with fallback)
- [ ] Titles show correctly
- [ ] Click navigates to new movie
- [ ] "Show More" pagination works

#### State Management Tests
- [ ] Loading states work correctly
- [ ] Error states display properly
- [ ] Retry functionality works
- [ ] No infinite loops occur
- [ ] State updates are smooth

#### Performance Tests

- [ ] No memory leaks after 10+ movie views
- [ ] Animations are smooth (60fps)
- [ ] Cache works correctly
- [ ] No excessive re-renders

#### Accessibility Tests
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader announces correctly
- [ ] ARIA labels are present

- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (Android)

### Step 5: Device Testing

Test on these devices:
- [ ] Desktop (1920x1080)
- [ ] Laptop (1366x768)
- [ ] Tablet (iPad)
- [ ] Mobile (iPhone)
- [ ] Mobile (Android)

### Step 6: Performance Monitoring

#### Before Migration Metrics
Record these metrics from the original version:
```
Initial render time: _______ms
Memory usage: _______MB
Re-renders per action: _______
Bundle size impact: _______KB
Time to interactive: _______ms
```

#### After Migration Metrics
Record these metrics from the improved version:
```
Initial render time: _______ms (target: <250ms)
Memory usage: _______MB (target: <20MB)
Re-renders per action: _______ (target: <3)
Bundle size impact: _______KB (target: <100KB)
Time to interactive: _______ms (target: <600ms)
```

### Step 7: Edge Cases Testing

- [ ] Very long movie titles
- [ ] Movies with no backdrop image
- [ ] Movies with no poster
- [ ] Movies with no cast
- [ ] Movies with no similar movies
- [ ] TV shows vs movies
- [ ] Network errors
- [ ] Slow connections (throttle to 3G)
- [ ] Offline mode
- [ ] Rapid movie switching

### Step 8: User Acceptance Testing

Get feedback from:
- [ ] Development team
- [ ] QA team
- [ ] Beta users (if available)
- [ ] Stakeholders

## Post-Migration Steps

### Step 1: Monitor in Production

Set up monitoring for:
```javascript
// Performance monitoring
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {
  // Track component mount time
  // Track memory usage
  // Track error rates
  // Track user interactions
}
```

### Step 2: Update Documentation

- [ ] Update component README
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Update testing documentation
- [ ] Update style guide

### Step 3: Clean Up

After successful migration (2+ weeks stable):
```bash
# Remove old version
rm MovieDetailsOverlay.legacy.jsx
rm MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx.backup

# Update imports throughout codebase
git grep -l "MovieDetailsOverlay.new" | xargs sed -i 's/MovieDetailsOverlay.new/MovieDetailsOverlay/g'

# Commit cleanup
git add .
git commit -m "Clean up after MovieDetailsOverlay migration"
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# Restore from backup
cp MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx.backup MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx

# Or restore from git
git checkout HEAD -- MovieDetailsOverlay.jsx

# Deploy immediately
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

### Investigate Issues
- Review error logs
- Check browser console
- Review user reports
- Compare metrics
- Identify specific failing tests

### Fix and Retry
- Fix identified issues
- Add regression tests
- Re-test thoroughly
- Attempt migration again

## Success Criteria

Migration is successful when:

- ✅ All tests pass
- ✅ No new errors in production
- ✅ Performance metrics improved by >50%
- ✅ Memory usage reduced by >50%
- ✅ No user complaints for 2 weeks
- ✅ Code review approved
- ✅ QA sign-off received
